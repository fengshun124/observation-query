Request observation related information via Python scripts.



## About STARALT

> Staralt is a program that shows the observability of objects in various ways: either you can plot altitude against time for a particular night (*Staralt*), or plot the path of your objects across the sky for a particular night (*Startrack*), or plot how altitude changes over a year (*Starobs*), or get a table with the best observing date for each object (*Starmult*).

## About the scripts

The scripts was first developed for requesting staralt output gif from the website. Yet due to the expanding needs, more website may be supported in the future.



The STARALT request is generated by `staralt.py`. Theoretically, the script allows requests to be made identically to the web page. Yet some of the values are set to default (e.g. the observatory name) to fit my own need. Please modify the script accordingly to suit whatever needs. `query_staralt.py` provides an instant that requests visibility for a table of cluster stars.



The CFHT request is generated by `cfht.py`. Instead of sending forms, it sends only a simple request, and get text file response. The script is designed to return the desired value, but it cannot handle exception value (likes `WARNING: ETC finds an exposure time iTexp=0.0 shorter than min applicable texp=11s. Exiting.)` More work are pending and improvement may be made in the future...



Future ToDo ~~üê¶~~

- date validation (to avoid dates like Feb. 30th)

- perform requests with preset configuration (maybe a JSON file or anything similar)

- ! fix exception response handling
